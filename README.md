## API Documentation

Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data:

1. **Current weather endpoint**:
   - `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}`
   - `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={API key}`
2. **5-day forecast endpoint**:
   - `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}`

Replace `{API key}` with your personal API key from OpenWeatherMap.

## Setup and Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies (if any)
npm install

# Run the project
npm start
```

## Running the Project Locally

1. First of all create a file named config.js in the js folder and configure API keys in `config.js` - replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' & 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY' with your API keys.
   ```javascript
   const CONFIG = {
       OPENWEATHER_API_KEY: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
       GEMINI_API_KEY: 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY',
       CHART_JS_VERSION: '3.7.0'
   };
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the dashboard locally.

## Deployment

Deployed using Firebase, accessible at: [https://nyx-weather.web.app/](https://nyx-weather.web.app/).

To run this project locally, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser after setting up your API key in the `config.js` file. Make sure you have an active internet connection for the API calls to work.
